Game Win Probability and Decision-Making Analysis

Overview

This project leverages real-time data from the College Football Data API to visualize win probabilities for college football games. The app is designed to highlight key moments in games and provide insights into critical plays that significantly influence the game’s outcome.

Built with Dash for interactivity and Plotly for visualizations, this project provides an intuitive way for football fans, analysts, and bettors to explore game-changing plays and understand how individual moments affect a team’s chances of winning. By combining API integration, data visualization, and interactive features, this project showcases a powerful, real-time analysis tool for sports data.

Features

	•	Dynamic Win Probability Graphs: The app provides an interactive visualization of win probabilities for both home and away teams over the course of the game. Users can track changes in real time and analyze how specific events 		affect each team’s chances.
	•	Top Plays Table: This feature highlights the top plays by win probability change, offering an easy way to identify critical moments during a game that had the most significant impact on its outcome.
	•	Interactive Dropdowns: Users can select the year, week, and specific game matchups using intuitive dropdowns. This allows for exploration of different games across various seasons and weeks.
	•	Real-Time Data: The app pulls live data from the College Football Data API to ensure the information displayed is up-to-date and relevant to current games.

Skills Demonstrated

This project highlights several core skills related to data analysis, application development, and API integration:

	•	Data Analysis: Utilized Pandas to clean, process, and analyze data from the College Football Data API, ensuring accurate representation of win probabilities and game insights.
	•	Data Visualization: Used Plotly to create dynamic, interactive graphs that clearly communicate win probability fluctuations over time.
	•	Web Application Development: Built a user-friendly and responsive app using Dash, allowing users to interact with the data via dropdowns and real-time graph updates.
	•	API Integration: Fetched and processed live game data from the College Football Data API, implementing error handling and ensuring smooth integration with the application.
	•	Real-Time Interactivity: Implemented responsive dropdowns and a dynamically updating user interface, allowing users to explore games and see real-time changes to the data.
